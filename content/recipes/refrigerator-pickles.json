      "ingredients": [
        "3 large cucumbers",
        "1 onion",
        "1 cup white sugar",
        "1½ Tbsp salt",
        "1½ Tbsp celery seed",
        "¼ tsp turmeric",
        "2 cups white vinegar"

  "directions": [
    "Thinly slice cucumber. I prefer a mandoline with the thinnest slicer. Slice the onion more thickly into rings. They are easier to remove for burgers or salads that way.",
    "Mix the vinegar and sugar in a sauce pan. If it doesn't all dissolve, warm on low and stir until dissolved.",
    "In a large container with a lid mix the liquid and seasoning. Traditionally we use an ice cream bucket, but I also use pretzel containers.",
    "Add the cucumber and onion and stir.",
    "Refrigerate at least overnight. The flavor will improve over time.",
    "Once the pickles are gone, you can re-use the liquid one more time, simply add more cucumbers."
