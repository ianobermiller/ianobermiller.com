While doing some profiling on [Socl][1], I noticed a particular jQuery selector that was taking an inordinate amount of time to run:

```javascript
var toTranslate = this.$element.find('.translatable').not('.translated');
```

The purpose of the code is to find elements that can be translated, but haven't been already. My suspicion was on the `.not()` addition, and lo and behold, inlining the clause into the first selector dramatically increased performance:

```javascript
var toTranslate = this.$element.find('.translatable:not(.translated)');
```

But, don't take my word alone for it; check out this

[jsPerf testing jQuery CSS3 :not vs .not()][2]. The creator of the test summed it up nicely:

> So the outcome is that it's faster to use a CSS3 selector in virtually all browsers (except IE8), by a factor of around 2-3.

Where performance isn't critical, however, heeding this advice about readability from the [jQuery :not() Selector documentation][3] would be wise:

> The .not() method will end up providing you with more readable selections than pushing complex selectors or variables into a :not() selector filter. In most cases, it is a better choice.
