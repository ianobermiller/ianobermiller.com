export const timing = {
  state: '60ms',
  context: '55ms',
  recoil: '300ms',
  eventEmitterWithState: '45ms',
  eventEmitterWithRef: '7ms',
};

I recently came across an internal post at Facebook asking if Recoil would be a
good solution for highlighting the row and column of a table when you select or
hover an individual cell. They had been using [React
context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) for this, but were running into
performance issues.

Inspired by the question, I took a look at the different
methods for highlighting a table row and column with React, including plain old
state, context, Recoil, and a custom event emitter. This post will compare the
code and performance of each solution, and I'll provide some takeaways at
the end.

## Setup

We'll start out with a simple table, broken into a few components. I used
create-react-app to bootstrap the project:

```bash
yarn create react-app table-highlighting
```

Then, replace `App.js` with the following code, which simply renders a large
table, breaking the table, row, and cell into separate components.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const ROWS = 400;
const COLUMNS = 30;

function App() {
  return <Table />;
}

function Table() {
  return (
    <table>
      <tbody>
        {
          // One-liner for _.range
          Array(ROWS)
            .fill()
            .map((_, i) => (
              <TableRow key={i} row={i} />
            ))
        }
      </tbody>
    </table>
  );
}

function TableRow({row}) {
  return (
    <tr>
      {Array(COLUMNS)
        .fill()
        .map((_, i) => (
          <TableCell key={i} row={row} column={i} />
        ))}
    </tr>
  );
}

function TableCell({row, column}) {
  return (
    <td>
      {row}x{column}
    </td>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Plain table example

import Harness from './Harness.js';
import TablePlain from './TablePlain.js';

<Harness>
  <TablePlain />
</Harness>

Alright, so we have a big table. Next, we want to highlight the entire column
and row whenever you hover over a single cell. Let's start with the simplest
solution posible, React component state at the table root.

## React state

For our first try, we will store the highlighted cell's row and column in the
top level `Table`'s component state.

```jsx
function Table() {
  const [highlightedCell, setHighlightedCell] = useState({
    row: -1,
    column: -1,
  });
  // ...
}
```

The state, along with a setter, will be
passed down through every row into each `TableCell` component, which will apply
its highlighted style and call the setter `onMouseEnter`.

```jsx
function TableCell({
  row,
  column,
  highlightedCell,
  setHighlightedCell,
}) {
  const isHighlighted =
    highlightedCell.row === row ||
    highlightedCell.column === column;

  return (
    <td
      onMouseEnter={() => setHighlightedCell({row, column})}
      style={isHighlighted ? highlightedStyle : null}>
      {row}x{column}
    </td>
  );
}
```

Try it out for yourself below. I've added in a timing hook to let us measure the
performance of each alternative.

### Table with state example

import TableState from './TableState.js';

<Harness>
  <TableState />
</Harness>

On my machine, hovering a cell takes about <span children={timing.state} /> [^1]. This is ok, but
won't get you to 60fps and may not scale with a larger table. Why, though?
You'll notice that this implementation re-renders everything on every hover; the
main `Table`, every `TableRow`, and every `TableCell`. We only need to update
the `TableCell` though. Luckily, "Context provides a way to pass data through
the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level."
(Source: [React Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)).

[^1]: Profiling was done using production mode React. After firing off the call to update state, the harness measures the elapsed time until an animation frame has completed. For recoil, though, two animation frames are required to capture all of the work that happens for some reason. The numbers look very fast for Recoil with a single animation frame, even though it is visually slow.

## React context

Next, we will modify the example to pass the highlighted cell down via context.

```jsx
const TableHighlightContext = React.createContext();

function Table() {
  const [highlightedCell, setHighlightedCell] = useState({
    row: -1,
    column: -1,
  });
  return (
    <TableHighlightContext.Provider value={highlightedCell}>
      <table>...</table>
    </TableHighlightContext.Provider>
  );
}
```

Memoize `TableRow` so that it doesn't re-render.

```jsx
const TableRow = React.memo(({row, setHighlightedCell}) => {
  // ...
});
```

And finally read the value in `TableCell` from context instead of props.

```jsx
function TableCell({row, column, setHighlightedCell}) {
  const highlightedCell = React.useContext(
    TableHighlightContext,
  );
  const isHighlighted =
    highlightedCell.row === row ||
    highlightedCell.column === column;
  // ...
}
```

### Table with context example

import TableContext from './TableContext.js';

<Harness>
  <TableContext />
</Harness>

Using context doesn't really affect the performance, resulting in about <span children={timing.context} />
again on my machine. It isn't that much faster because all 12,000 `TableCell`
components are still re-rendering every single time you hover a cell. But, we
know that we only need to re-render the cells that are changing, which should be
at most two rows and columns worth, or 860 cells.

Recoil is one (of many) state libraries for React that can help with the
problem of granular state updates.

## Recoil

The problem with context is that too many components were re-rendering.
[Recoil](https://recoiljs.org/) is a state management library that allows
components to subscribe only to the atomic units of state (called atoms) that
they need to render. So, each cell should be able to subscribe to the value it
needs (that is, to know whether or not it is highlighted) and only re-render
when that value changes.

To integrate Recoil, we'll create an atom to hold the highlightedCell.

```jsx
const highlightedCell = atom({
  key: 'highlightedCell',
  default: {row: -1, column: -1},
});
```

Wrap `Table` in `RecoilRoot`.

```tsx
function Table() {
  return (
    <RecoilRoot>
      <table>...</table>
    </RecoilRoot>
  );
}
```

Create a [`selectorFamily`](https://recoiljs.org/docs/api-reference/utils/selectorFamily) that will create a new selector for each cell,
returning a boolean indicating whether or not this cell is highlighted.

```jsx
const isHighlightedSelector = selectorFamily({
  key: 'isHighlightedSelector',
  get: ({row, column}) => ({get}) => {
    const h = get(highlightedCell);
    return h.row === row || h.column === column;
  },
});
```

And finally use the atom and the selector family in the `TableCell` component:

```jsx
function TableCell({row, column}) {
  const isHighlighted = useRecoilValue(
    isHighlightedSelector({row, column}),
  );
  const setHighlightedCell = useSetRecoilState(
    highlightedCell,
  );
  return (
    <td
      onMouseEnter={() => setHighlightedCell({row, column})}
      style={isHighlighted ? highlightedStyle : null}>
      {row}x{column}
    </td>
  );
}
```

### Table with Recoil example

import TableRecoil from './TableRecoil.js';

<Harness>
  <TableRecoil />
</Harness>

On my machine, the Recoil example is surprisingly the slowest, at <span children={timing.recoil} /> per
hover. I'm not actually sure why, and I'll update this post after asking the
Recoil team. From a cursory look, all the `TableCell`s were re-rendering twice
for each change to the atom, which would of course be slow.

Recoil has another performance issue, which you'll have noticed if you started
the example above. It takes a considerable amount of time to start. This is
because `selectorFamily` actually creates a selector (and its associated entry
in the Redux root store) for every single cell, which (as of this version of
Recoil) is not very optimized.

We've gone through state, context, and Recoil, the only thing left is to roll
our own customized state management.

## Custom event emitter

As mentioned before, for peak performance we need to make sure all 12,000
`TableCell` components don't re-render at once. Only the cells that are changing
need to re-render, which should be at most two rows and columns worth, or 860
cells.

We can accomplish this by rolling our own simple event emitter to listen for the
hoverer cell (identified by the row and column) to change, and then only
notifying the cells that are changing by calling a callback, which will in turn
set some local state.

We'll start out with the event emitter.

```jsx
// Use an IIFE to contain the variable declarations. In a
// production app, I'd probably make this a class so you can
// test the instances, and also throw it into context to
// avoid the global.
const emitter = (() => {
  // 2d array indexed by row and column
  const subs = [];
  return {
    // Subscribe function that will be called once for each
    // cell, in a useEffect
    subscribe(r, c, cb) {
      subs[r] = subs[r] ?? [];
      // Note that this does not handle multiple
      // subscriptions for the same cell
      subs[r][c] = cb;
      // This will be invoked by useEffect's cleanup
      return () => delete subs[r][c];
    },
    // Called by each cell when it is hovered
    highlight(newRow, newCol) {
      subs.forEach((row, r) => {
        row.forEach((cb, c) => {
          const isHighlighted =
            r === newRow || c === newCol;
          // useState won't rerender the component if the
          // value hasn't changed, so we can call it for
          // every cell
          cb(isHighlighted);
        });
      });
    },
  };
})();
```

The implementation is rather simplistic, and does not handle multiple
subscriptions for the same cell, but it will suffice for our purposes.

Next we update `TableCell` to subscribe to the event emitter
and keep its own highlighted state.

```jsx
function TableCell({row, column}) {
  const [isHighlighted, setIsHighlighted] = useState(false);
  useEffect(() => {
    // Subscribe and return the result to remove the
    // callback when the component unmounts
    return emitter.subscribe(row, column, setIsHighlighted);
  }, [column, row]);
  return (
    <td
      onMouseEnter={() => emitter.highlight(row, column)}
      style={isHighlighted ? highlightedStyle : null}>
      {row}x{column}
    </td>
  );
}
```

### Table with custom event emitter example

import TableEventEmitter from './TableEventEmitter.js';

<Harness>
  <TableEventEmitter />
</Harness>

This implementation is the fastest yet, at <span
children={timing.eventEmitterWithState} />. The speed here comes from
only rerendering the cells that change. But can we do better?

## Direct DOM manipulation

You'll notice a pattern of cutting React out of the picture, which
tends to speed things up. By modeling the highlighting with a domain
specific event emitter, we only call React when the component actually
needs to change. However, we don't actually need to use React state to
update the component. Instead, we can get a `ref` to the underlying
DOM element and update the styles directly.

Since we will be doing work in every callback, and React won't be
deduping, we want to avoid calling the subscriber's callback if the
highlighted state isn't changing for that cell.

```jsx
const emitter = (() => {
  // Keep track of the currently highlighted row and column
  let currentRow = -1;
  let currentCol = -1;
  const subs = [];
  return {
    subscribe(r, c, cb) {
      subs[r] = subs[r] ?? [];
      subs[r][c] = cb;
      return () => delete subs[r][c];
    },
    highlight(newRow, newCol) {
      subs.forEach((row, r) => {
        row.forEach((cb, c) => {
          const wasHighlighted =
            r === currentRow || c === currentCol;
          const isHighlighted =
            r === newRow || c === newCol;
          // Only notify if the highlighting for this row
          // has changed. We could optimize this loop to
          // only run for the changed rows, but you're
          // unlikely to see noticable gains.
          if (wasHighlighted !== isHighlighted) {
            cb(isHighlighted);
          }
        });
      });

      // Update the currently highlighted cell, otherwise
      // you'll never unhighlight the old ones.
      currentRow = newRow;
      currentCol = newCol;
    },
  };
})();
```

Then, in the event emitter callback, instead of setting the `style`
prop, we can get another small boost (from 10ms to 7ms) by toggling a class using
`node.classList.toggle`.

```jsx
function TableCell({row, column}) {
  const ref = useRef();
  useEffect(() => {
    emitter.subscribe(row, column, isHighlighted => {
      if (ref.current) {
        // Directly update the class on the DOM node
        ref.current.classList.toggle(
          'highlight-cell',
          isHighlighted,
        );
      }
    });
  }, [column, row]);
  return (
    <td
      onMouseEnter={() => emitter.highlight(row, column)}
      ref={ref}>
      {row}x{column}
    </td>
  );
}
```

### Table with event emitter and ref

import TableEventEmitterRef from './TableEventEmitterRef.js';

<Harness>
  <TableEventEmitterRef />
</Harness>

Directly manipulating the DOM paid off, as this one clocks in at a
blazing <span
children={timing.eventEmitterWithRef} />, well within the 16ms limit
to hit 60 frames per second.

## Takeaways

- **React is fast.** The naive implementation
  with global state performed very well, considering we were
  updating over 12,000 components at once. It is worth
  noting that you will likely have other performance
  troubles besides highlighting if you are rendering that
  many components at once, and you'd probably want to look
  into virtualizing the table with something like
  [react-window](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-window)
  first, which would probably make most of this article
  moot.
- **Recoil isn't a panacea.** Especially if you have
  thousands of selectors, Recoil may not be your best bet.
  They are actively working on performance with many atoms and
  selectors, so I expect this to improve.
- **Avoid invoking React at all for top speed.** At the end
  of the day, React has to perform DOM manipulations to get
  anything done, so if you have a simple way to remove
  React from the critical path it will nearly always be
  faster.
