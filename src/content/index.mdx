title: About
---

I am striving to faithfully live out my truest identity as a child of God and disciple of Jesus in Seattle as a husband, dad, and software engineer at Facebook.

## Facebook

I&#8217;ve worked in the [Facebook][14] Seattle office, with amazing views of the city and Lake Union, since 2013. Our team is changing the way Facebook approaches and executes product design with a purpose-built tool using [React][1] and [Redux][2].

### Prior

Before Facebook I worked at Microsoft, on teams ranging from AdCenter to Windows Phone Research and [FUSE Labs][3]. At FUSE we implemented and researched new and awesome ways to make computers more social, since people are really the most essential and basic concept in computing.

## Education

In pursuit of continual learning, and to figure out a little bit more about all the things I don&#8217;t know, I earned my master’s in computer science from the University of Washington via the [Professional Masters Program][4]. The courses were awesome and relevant to my job as a software engineer in addition to being fast-paced and intense.

A few years before that, I graduated summa cum laude from [Marquette University][5] with an Honors Bachelor&#8217;s degree in Computer Science. In addition to taking a full load of credits and coding on the side as a web developer, I also worked in the [Ubicomp Lab][6], learning about and building wireless, pervasive computing systems.

## For Fun

Somehow I have the desire to be on the computer when I&#8217;m not working, and then I usually spend a bit too much time reading [HN][7] or &#8220;[industry][8] [happenings][9].&#8221; Occasionally, I [write code to share][10] or attempt to learn a [new programming language][11]. Outside of the digital world, I love [diving into the awesome Word of God][12], building legos and playing [point and click adventure games][13] with my four kids, and eating froyo while watching movies with my inspiring wife.
