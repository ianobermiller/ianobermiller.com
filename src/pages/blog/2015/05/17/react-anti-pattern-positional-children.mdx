When designing reusable components with React, you may need to dig into the `children` prop, say to wrap each child in another element or change the ordering. Once you&#8217;ve done so, you may also be tempted to do different things depending on the index of the child. An example from the Facebook codebase is the `<LeftRight>` component, which floats one child to the left, and another to the right. Its API looks like this:

```xml
&lt;LeftRight&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;floated to the left&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;floated to the right&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/LeftRight&gt;

```

Instead, simplify the API of `<LeftRight>` and pass the two children as props instead:

```xml
&lt;LeftRight
  left={&lt;div&gt;floated to the left&lt;/div&gt;}
  right={&lt;div&gt;floated to the right&lt;/div&gt;}
/&gt;

```

The props-based version:

  * Is easier to implement &#8211; no mucking about with `React.Children`
  * Is easier to use, since the API to the component is now explicit
  * Can have better validation, like requiring the props to be of a certain type
  * Is more flexible &#8211; what if `left` wasn&#8217;t required?
