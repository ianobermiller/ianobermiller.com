If you&#8217;re building a React app for production using webpack, don&#8217;t forget this simple plugin for your production build:

```javascript
new webpack.DefinePlugin({
  'process.env': {NODE_ENV: '"production"'}
})

```

It will replace all instances of `process.env.NODE_ENV` with the string `"production"`. When used in conjunction with the uglify plugin, all the code in React that is inside a dev only conditional like `if ("production" !== process.env.NODE_ENV) { ... }` will be stripped.

On my simple app, this shaved 45kb off the production build before gzip. After gzip saved 13.5kb, still not bad. Win!
