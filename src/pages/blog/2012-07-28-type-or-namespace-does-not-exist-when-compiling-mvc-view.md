I ran into the following common error when trying to run my ASP.NET MVC 4 website:

`d:\temp\2pirqzul.5yz\temp\root\898a687c\8681620c\App_Web_jfuizczv.0.cs(27): error CS0234: The type or namespace name 'Models' does not exist in the namespace 'DealBoxy' (are you missing an assembly reference?)`

While normally a straightforward error, this one was confusing, because I was certain that I had referenced the `DealBoxy` project correctly.

It turns out that DealBoxy was compiling to an exe, and apparently ASP.NET won&#8217;t load exes the same way it will dlls. Changing the Output type to Class Library in the Application tab of the project settings did the trick.
