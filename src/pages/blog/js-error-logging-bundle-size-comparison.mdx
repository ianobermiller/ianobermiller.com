So, you've optimized your JavaScript bundle into a lean and mean package, but
now you need to add error logging so that you are aware of errors that users
experience in production. How do the major JavaScript error logging services
stack up in terms of bundle size?

This is of course a na√Øve comparison, as many services provide other
functionality as well, like session replay. But if you are just looking for
basic error reporting while keeping bundle size small, knowing how much these
libraries will increase your payload matters.

The methodology can be found in the Source column of the table. For most
providers, I checked the docs for a client-side NPM bundle and popped that into
[Bundlephobia](https://bundlephobia.com). If the provider does not have an NPM
module, I `curl`ed the JS directly.
