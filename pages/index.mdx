I am striving to faithfully live out my truest identity as a
child of God and disciple of Jesus in Jacksonville as a husband,
dad, and software engineer at Netflix.

## Netflix

Our team at Netflix builds components to increase developer
productivity and design consistency for the Netflix TV app.
It's familiar because we use React, but there are plenty of
new quirks to learn because of the custom [Gibbon renderer](https://netflixtechblog.com/crafting-a-high-performance-tv-user-interface-using-react-3350e5a6ad3b).

### Facebook

I had the pleasure of working from the
[Facebook](http://facebook.com/ianobermiller) Seattle
office, with amazing views of the city and Lake Union, from
2013 to 2021. We built a web-based, component-centric design
tool to change the way Facebook approached and executed
product design.

### Microsoft

At Microsoft, I worked on teams ranging from AdCenter to
Windows Phone Research and [FUSE Labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/microsoft_fuse_labs). At
FUSE we implemented and researched new and awesome ways to
make computers more social, since people are really the most
essential and basic concept in computing.

## Education

In pursuit of continual learning, and to figure out a little
bit more about all the things I don&#8217;t know, I studied
computer science at [Marquette University](https://www.marquette.edu/) and went on to earn
my masterâ€™s degree from the University of Washington via the
[Professional Masters Program](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/pmp/). The
courses were awesome and relevant to my job as a software
engineer in addition to being fast-paced and intense.

## For Fun

Somehow I have the desire to be on the computer when
I&#8217;m not working, and then I usually spend a bit too
much time reading [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/) or
&#8220;[industry](https://react.statuscode.com/)
[happenings](https://javascriptweekly.com/).&#8221;
Occasionally, I [write code to share](https://github.com/ianobermiller) or attempt to learn
a new programming language. Outside of the digital world, I
love [diving into the awesome Word of God](https://my.bible.com/users/ianobermiller/highlights),
building LEGO and playing games with my four kids (Love
Letters, Otrio, Voltage, Katan, Untitled Goose Game), and
eating froyo while watching movies with my inspiring wife.
