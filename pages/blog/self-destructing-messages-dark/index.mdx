Ever needed to send a password or other sensitive
information to someone over email or text? Both mediums are
insecure, unencrypted, and persistent, which means there are
many opportunities for someone nefarious to find that
information and exploit it.

There are many websites that offer to encrypt some text
and allow it to be viewed only once from a given link. The
problem with all of them is that I didn't write them, and
have to trust their authors and the entire chain of
deployment. I've used [1ty.me](https://1ty.me/) many times
in the past and had no issues, but I figured it couldn't be
that hard to build a simple clone, and it would be a good
excuse to play around more with
[Dark](https://darklang.com).

To see what I'll be walking you through below, visit
https://ianobermiller.com/secure.

## Backend

Throughout this process I tried to do things the "Dark way"
as much as possible, using "trace driven development"
and relying on the repl. I went through a couple iterations
for the API design, but ended up with this:

- `/upload` takes `text` that was encrypted on the client in
  a `POST` payload, puts it in the database and returns a `uuid`
- `/download` takes the `uuid`, returns the encrypted text,
  and deletes the payload

### Database

<Image src={dbImage} width={1480} height={390} />

First, I created a database to store the messages. It
started out very simple, with only a `text` field of type
`String`. Later, I added a `createdAt` field of type `Date`
so that I can periodically clean up the database to remove
old messages. Note that once a database has data, the schema
cannot be changed, so you have to delete all the records
first. That is easy enough by using a repl with the
following:

```fsharp
DB::deleteAllv1 Messages
```

### Upload

In the client UI, the user enters a message and clicks
"Generate Link", which encrypts the data on the client and
sends it to the `/upload` endpoint.

I wrote some very simple client-side code in TypeScript
while testing in order to load a trace into Dark. It looked
something like this:

```typescript
const BASE_API =
  'https://ianobermiller-secure.builtwithdark.com/';

const response = await fetch(BASE_API + '/upload', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
  body: JSON.stringify({text: 'Hello world'}),
});
```

> Note: This works from `localhost` or from your own custom
> domain because [Dark sets CORs headers by
> default](https://docs.darklang.com/cors/).

You can use a snippet or the console from your browser to
make the request without even standing up a site. Once
you've made the request switch back to Dark and under 404s
on the left side you can select the `/upload` endpoint and
start coding:

```fsharp
let text = request.body.text
if String::lengthv1 text > 1024
then
  Http::badRequest "Text too long: text is limited to 256 ch
                   aracters"
else
  let key = DB::generateKey
  let _ = DB::setv1
            {
              text : text
              createdAt : Date::now
            }
            key
            Messages
  {
    id : key
  }
```

Before saving the message, the code rejects any requests
that are too long. The client also enforces this, but those
checks can be bypassed by sending a request directly. The
checked length (1024) is actually greater than the reported
max (256) because the client will encrypt and base64 encode
the message, adding overhead.

Next, it generates a database key (a UUID) using
`DB::generateKey` and inserts a record into the database
with the current date. Finally, the last row returns a JSON
object with the `id`, for example `{id: "482e50a5-dbb5-4cc5-9fcd-0c94470f60b3"}`. The client will
put the ID into a url which the user will send to the
message recipient.

To check that this code works and the database contains what
I expect I can add a new repl with:

```fsharp
DB::getAllWithKeysv2 Messages
```

The result might look something like:

```json
{
  5ee86e28-3ce9-4173-97b5-d68bdd8ca1e9: {
    createdAt: <Date: 2021-04-11T05:17:04Z>,
    text: "Hello world"
  }
}
```

### Download

When the recipient visits the url, the client's JavaScript
will call the `/download` endpoint.

Once again, to leverage trace-driven development I wrote a
simple version of the client side code to generate a trace
to write the backend:

```typescript
const response = await fetch(BASE_API + '/download', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    id: '5ee86e28-3ce9-4173-97b5-d68bdd8ca1e9',
  }),
});
```

Once executed, I select `/download` in the 404s section and
fill it in:

```fsharp
let entry = DB::getv2 request.body.id Messages
let _ = DB::deletev1 request.body.id Messages
{
  text : entry.text
}
```

Download simply fetches the message, deletes it, and returns
the text. If any of the operations fail, like `DB::get` when
the ID doesn't exist, the call will enter the ["error
rail"](https://docs.darklang.com/tutorials/error-rail-http-tutorial/)
and return an empty response.

> (since it deletes the message) and therefore shouldn't be a
> GET to begin with. Second, Dark works best if you have
> separate routes for each endpoint, allowing you to more
> easily switch between traces and keep the code separate.

### Delete Expired Messages

For this simple application I want any messages to be
automatically deleted if they are not read in 7 days. Dark
supports scheduled jobs like this via a Cron component.

```fsharp
let deleteBeforeDate = Date::subtract Date::now 60 * 60 * 24 * 7
let keysToDelete = DB::queryWithKeyv3 Messages \entry -> entry.createdAt Date::<= deleteBeforeDate
Dict::map keysToDelete \key, value -> DB::deletev1 key Messages
```

I went back and added the created date and time to each
database entry, so removing stale messages is a matter of
computing the time 7 days ago, querying for messages created
before that date, and deleting them.

Note that `DB::queryWithKey` is special -- it takes a lambda
function and compiles it to a database query. You are limited
as to what you can put inside, which is why the code to
compute `deleteBeforeDate` is outside of the lambda. If you
don't do this, you will get an error message like:

> Error: You're using our new experimental Datastore query compiler. It compiles your lambdas into optimized (and partially indexed) Datastore queries, which should be reasonably faster.
>
> Unfortunately, we hit a snag while compiling your lambda. We only support a subset of Dark's functionality, but will be expanding it in the future.
>
> Some Dark code is not supported in DB::query lambdas for now, and some of it won't be supported because it's an odd thing to do in a datastore query. If you think your operation should be supported, let us know in #general.
>
> Error: We do not yet support compiling this code: (EBlank 1223731764)>

Since Dark does not yet have a bulk deletion command, the
last line simply maps over all the keys and deletes them one
by one.

## Client

With the API feature complete, I built out the simple UI
using `fetch` and React. The [full source code can be found
on
GitHub](https://github.com/ianobermiller/ianobermiller.com/blob/5ee080fbd1a1359fbede7a0ec55270e363b3fd54/pages/secure/index.page.tsx).
Overall, the code is pretty straightforward, with separate
components for viewing a message, creating a message, and
the creation confirmation screen. I've included more details
of the interesting bits below.

### Encryption

Since the whole point of a secure message is to send
sensitive information, it is important that the server
cannot read the data. So, the first step is to encrypt the
data. To keep things simple, I used `crypto.subtle` with
128-bit AES encryption. A larger key would in theory be
safer, but it results in longer urls and in practice
128 bits will be fine considering the short-lived nature of
a self-destructing message.

The encryption code was copied and modified from (this
gist)[https://gist.github.com/andreburgaud/6f73fd2d690b629346b8].

### URL

The entire point of this project is to send someone a simple
url, like
`https://ianobermiller.com/secure#rVCv88kDTLWAlToREDhbRQ=qwoiNo1iV6OFPpy_EcEVAw`,
and have them view the contents of the message. I went
through a few iterations on the url before landing here.

First, I want the decryption key (the part after the `=`
sign) to be in the hash of the url, since the hash is not
sent to the server. This gives you extra confidence that the
server cannot decrypt your message.

I originally tried to put the ID in the path, like
`/secure/rVCv88kDTLWAlToREDhbRQ`, but realized that wouldn't
work for a statically generated site deployment, which is
how I deploy ianobermiller.com using Next.js on Vercel. Next
I considered a url parameter, e.g.
`/secure?id=rVCv88kDTLWAlToREDhbRQ`, but ended up sticking
both the ID and the key in the hash to keep parsing simple.
If the backend was moved to the same server, having the ID
sent to the server in the original request would save a
round trip, since the server could send back the encrypted
message without waiting for the client code to download it.

You'll also notice that the ID in the url,
`rVCv88kDTLWAlToREDhbRQ` doesn't look like the UUID we
generated on the Dark backend. Since a UUID is just a 128
bit number, it can be re-encoded into a friendlier form.
Here, I use the `uuid` library and url-safe base64 encoding
to transform the UUID given from Dark into a shorter, more
friendly looking random string:

```tsx
import {parse as uuidParse} from 'uuid';
import {encode} from './base64';

function uuidToBase64(uuid: string): string {
  return encode(uuidParse(uuid));
}
```

## Conclusion

This was a fun project to practice using Dark and stand up a
simple but useful service for myself. Future improvements
might include:

- Emailing the sender when the link is viewed
- Configurable length of time until self-destruction
