In my last post on Dark, I created a [self-destructing
message app](/blog/self-destructing-messages-dark) that lets
you share a secret, like a password, with someone by sharing
a link. When they view the message it will be deleted on the
server. A nice feature would be to notify the sender via
email when their message was viewed.

To start, we will modify the React client to pass the email
address to the backend:

```tsx{4}
const response = await fetch(BASE_API + '/upload', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
  body: JSON.stringify({text: cipherText, email}),
});
```

Then we can submit the form, now including an email, to
create a trace in Dark. Recall from our last post that we
have a Datastore named `Messages`, that has two fields,
`text` and `createdAt`. In order to add a new field, we will
need to clear the Datastore:

```fsharp
DB::deleteAllv1 Messages
```

Then we can add a new field `email` of type `String`. Next,
as we process the message upload, we will include the
`email` in the call to `DB::set`:

```fsharp{12}
let text = request.body.text
if String::lengthv1 text > 1024
then
  Http::badRequest "Text too long: text is limited to 256 ch
                   aracters"
else
  let key = DB::generateKey
  let _ = DB::setv1
            {
              text : text
              createdAt : Date::now
              email : request.body.email
            }
            key
            Messages
  {
    id : key
  }
```

Finally we get to the part where we actually send an email.
I used (sendinblue)[https://www.sendinblue.com/] because
they have a generous free tier and good docs with an easy to
use API. Once you've signed up, create a new Secret Key in
Dark by clicking the `+` next to "Secret Keys". Call it
`SENDINBLUE_API` and paste in your API key.

Then we'll create a function in Dark to keep the `/download`
handler concise. Click the `+` next to "Functions" and call
it `emailMessageViewed`. We will setup this function with
one paramter `email` of type `String`.

In the body we will use sendinblue's REST API to send a
confirmation email:

```fsharp
HttpClient::postv5
  "https://api.sendinblue.com/v3/smtp/email"
  {
    sender : {
               name : "Secure Message"
               email : "noreply@ianobermiller.com"
             }
    to : [{
            email : email
          }]
    subject : "Secure Message Viewed"
    htmlContent : "<html><head></head><body><p>Your secure
                  message has been viewed and deleted.</p>
                  <p><a href="https://ianobermiller.com/se
                  cure">Create a new message</a></p></body
                  ></html>"
  }
  {}
  {
    api-key : SENDINBLUE_API
  }
```

This is quite straightforward since Dark provides good
helpers for making HTTP calls. In this case we use the
sendinblue API endpoint
`https://api.sendinblue.com/v3/smtp/email`, pass in a JSON
blob with the `sender`, `to`, `subject`, and `htmlContent`,
and finally set the `api-key` header to our Secret Key named
`SENDINBLUE_API`.

Finally, let's call this new function from our `/download'
handlers:

```fsharp{3-7}
let entry = DB::getv2 request.body.id Messages
let _ = DB::deletev1 request.body.id Messages
let _ = if entry.email
        then
          emailMessageViewed entry.email
        else
          Nothing
{
  text : entry.text
}
```

Since the email is optional, we want to verify it is
non-empty before trying to send a confirmation. And that's
all there is to it!
