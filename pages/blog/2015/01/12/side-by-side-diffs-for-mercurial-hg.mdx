**UPDATE:** This is easier now! See my new post, ["Side-by-side diffs for Mercurial (hg) & icdiff revisited"][1].

Ever wish for `hg diff` in side-by-side view? I find it much easier to scan, assuming you have the horizontal real-estate in your terminal. Here is a simple guide to setting up side-by-side diffs in Mercurial on Linux/OSX:<!-- more -->

## 1. Install icdiff

The grunt of this work will be done by [icdiff][2], an excellent tool by Jeff Kaufman. Download and install icdiff, making sure `/usr/local/bin` is in your `$PATH.`

## 2. Adapter scripts

Since icdiff only operates on individual files, we need to provide an adapter for it to work with directories. We'll use a modified version of Bryan O'Sullivan's hg-interdiff script. Drop this into `~/scripts/hg-icdiff`, and then run `chmod +x ~/scripts/hg-icdiff` to make it executable:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env python
#
# Adapter for using interdiff with mercurial's extdiff extension.

import os, sys

def walk(base):
    # yield all non-directories below the base path.
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(base):
        for f in files:
            path = os.path.join(root, f)
            yield path[len(base)+1:], path
    else:
        if os.path.isfile(base):
            yield '', base

# create list of unique file names under both directories.
files = dict(walk(sys.argv[1]))
files.update(walk(sys.argv[2]))
files = files.keys()
files.sort()

def name(base, f):
    if f:
        path = os.path.join(base, f)
    else:
        path = base
    # interdiff requires two files; use /dev/null if one is missing.
    if os.path.exists(path):
        return path
    return '/dev/null'

ret = 0

for f in files:
    if os.system('icdiff "%s" "%s"' % (name(sys.argv[1], f),
                                          name(sys.argv[2], f))):
        ret = 1

sys.exit(ret)
```

Next, we want this to be piped into `less` for easy paging, so put the following code in `~/scripts/hg-icdiff-wrapper`, and also `chmod +x` it. The `-F` parameter makes `less` not page if the output fits in the screen.

```bash
$HOME/scripts/hg-icdiff "$@"|less -F -X
```

## 3. Mercurial settings

Next, lets configure Mercurial so that it knows about our script. Add the following to your `~/.hgrc` (note the absolute path; I was not able to get it working with tilde `~` or `$HOME`):

```bash
[extensions]
extdiff=

[extdiff]
cmd.icdiff=/home/iano/scripts/hg-icdiff-wrapper
```

You can now replace `diff` in your Mercurial commands with `icdiff`, and it will do a side-by-side diff instead of inline.

## 4.Â Aliases

Finally, since `hg icdiff` is too long, add the following aliases to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
# side-by-side diffs for uncommitted files
alias ic='hg icdiff'

# diff all changes since the base revision, including uncommitted
# (from master if you are using bookmarks, for example)
alias ica='hg icdiff -r .^'

# diff the existing changes, excluding uncommitted
alias ice='hg icdiff --ch .'
```
