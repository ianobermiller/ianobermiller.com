If you've adopted JavaScript classes when working with React, you may be missing `PureRenderMixin`. You can emulate it easily using decorators:

```javascript
var shallowEqual = require('react/lib/shallowEqual');
module.exports = function PureRender(Component) {
  Component.prototype.shouldComponentUpdate = function (
    nextProps,
    nextState,
  ) {
    return (
      !shallowEqual(this.props, nextProps) ||
      !shallowEqual(this.state, nextState)
    );
  };
  return Component;
};
```

Use it with the decorator syntax or just as a wrapper around your component:

```javascript
@PureRender
class Button extends Component { ... }

Button = PureRender(Button);
```

The logic is exactly the same as `PureRenderMixin`. Keep in mind that this could break if/when React's internals are rearranged, since we are deeply requiring `shallowEqual`. This hasn't been published to NPM, but if you'd like to see it drop me a comment. Hopefully a pure rendering decorator will make its way into [react-pure-render][1] instead.
