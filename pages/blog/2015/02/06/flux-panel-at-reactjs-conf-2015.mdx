Last week in Menlo Park was the first ReactJS conference, hosted by Facebook. I had the honor of being on the Flux Panel with some amazing developers. [Bill Fisher][1] did an excellent job preparing us for the panel and moderating, and it is chock full of nuggets of wisdom from those of us building some of the largest React+Flux apps. Topics include Relay vs Flux, isomorphic apps, maintainability, and approaches to data fetching.

(That's me in the coveted React t-shirt, by the way)
