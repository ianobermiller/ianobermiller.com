A [while back][1] I told you how to get side-by-side diffs in Mercurial using icdiff. Turns out the author of icdiff has added the `--recursive` flag to make the tool accept directories and diff the contents of the files within. New setup instructions follow.

## 1. Install icdiff

Same as before: Download and install [icdiff][2], making sure `/usr/local/bin` is in your `$PATH.`

## 2. Setup Mercurial

Next, lets configure Mercurial so that it knows about `icdiff`. We'll also set the default pager for all commands to `less`. Add the following to your `~/.hgrc`.

```bash
[extensions]
extdiff=
pager=

[extdiff]
cmd.icdiff=icdiff
# extdiff passes two directories to the diff command
# --recursive tells icdiff to treat the two params as directories
# and recursively diff their contents.
# -- line-numbers shows line numbers on both sides
opts.icdiff=--recursive --line-numbers

[pager]
# Setting the variable LESS is like passing those options to less.
# In this case, -F (quit if fits on screen), and -R (pass through control chars,
# required for color output)
pager = LESS='FR' less
# Use pager for these commands only. Add any commands you use here.
attend = icdiff,diff,status,log
```

You can now replace `diff` in your Mercurial commands with `icdiff`, and it will do a side-by-side diff instead of inline.

## 3. Aliases (optional)

Finally, since `hg icdiff` is of course too long, add the following aliases to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
# side-by-side diffs for uncommitted files
alias ic='hg icdiff'

# diff all changes since the base revision, including uncommitted
# (from master if you are using bookmarks, for example)
alias ica='hg icdiff -r .^'

# diff the existing changes, excluding uncommitted
alias ice='hg icdiff --ch .'
```
